Starling Extension: Dynamic Lighting
====================================

The classes contained in this project add support for dynamic lighting to the Starling Framework. This will allow you to use normal maps for realistic lighting effects.

Beware: this extension requires Starling Framework 2.0 in the very latest head revision.

* The normal maps in this demo were created using the excellent [SpriteIlluminator](https://www.codeandweb.com/spriteilluminator) from Andreas LÃ¶w.
* You can add up to 8 light sources.
* Light sources may be configured as point-, directional-, or ambient lights.
* More information about this extension can be found in the [Starling Wiki](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/extensions/dynamic_lighting).
