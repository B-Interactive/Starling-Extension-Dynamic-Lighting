Starling Extension: Dynamic Lighting
====================================

The classes contained in this project add support for dynamic lighting to the Starling Framework. This will allow you to use normal maps for realistic lighting effects.

Beware: this extension requires Starling Framework 2.0, which is not available to the general public yet. Thus, this project currently acts as a demo about what will be possible with Starling 2.0.

* The normal maps in this demo were created using the excellent [SpriteIlluminator](https://www.codeandweb.com/spriteilluminator) from Andreas LÃ¶w.
* Currently, this extension supports only one point light. More features will be added soon. 
* More information about this extension can be found in the [Starling Wiki](link).
